# Next-Generation-Video-AI-Unlocking-Efficiency-with-Psychovisual-Perception-Models
Perception-aware video inference for computer vision. This repo explores how to cut compute and memory by ignoring redundant, non-salient frames and features, aligning models with what humans reliably perceive. Goal: faster, lighter, more robust video recognition with fewer errors from unlabeled, irrelevant stimuli.
